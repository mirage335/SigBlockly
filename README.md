# SigBlockly

Free Open Source Software (FOSS) direct graphical programming environment focused on realtime signal processing, control systems, and application integration.

# Usage

firefox ./c.html

firefox ./bash.html

# Design
Intended to support graphical programming of critical algorithms, signal processors, high-level directives, and configuration snippets, rather than complete programs.

Snippets of XML generated by the code tool may be stored as code comments, or separate files, for future graphical editing.

# Blockly [![Build Status]( https://travis-ci.org/google/blockly.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/google/blockly)


Google's Blockly is a web-based, visual programming editor.  Users can drag
blocks together to build programs.  All code is free and open source.

**The project page is https://developers.google.com/blockly/**

Blockly has an active [developer forum](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/blockly). Please drop by and say hello. Show us your prototypes early; collectively we have a lot of experience and can offer hints which will save you time.

Help us focus our development efforts by telling us [what you are doing with
Blockly](https://developers.google.com/blockly/registration). The questionnaire only takes
a few minutes and will help us better support the Blockly community.
